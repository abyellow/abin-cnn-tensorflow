# Pinterest-classification-dnn-cnn-tensorflow


The project is to apply deep learning techniques to classify the Pinterest images. Training data set is available from the researchers in College of Education of MSU. These data contains the downloaded educational pins from teachers in the their sample. A list of key words were used to filter potential education-related boards (folder contains pins). Therefore we need to further filter out the mathematical pins since only pins related to mathematics teaching and learning. We would also organize our own attributes if we find any new label is more reasonable.  These cleaned images were firstly classified to two sets of classes and then the results are compared with the ground truth to measure the accuracy of our proposed algorithm. Our new model should perform equivalently or even better than the basic methods in the existing public libraries, in the current most popular deep learning tools such as Google's TensorFlow. At the last step, we would plan to build an interactive user friendly web-based interface if time is available.
